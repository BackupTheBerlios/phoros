A Tool for Photogrammetric Road Survey

* Workflow

  - Images and GPS data are acquired using a measuring vehicle. ([[http://www.tu-dresden.de/vkiva/strasse/messfahrzeug.html][Here]]
    is a working example.)

    Sequences of a few hundred images together with their trigger times are stored
    Huffman-encoded in files called =*.pictures=.  GPS data is
    preprocessed into a table of ASCII text.  The format of both image
    and GPS files is not (yet) explained here.

  - Cameras and GPS system need to be calibrated, which is not
    explained here.

  - Calibration parameters are stored into the database using the
    [[Command Line Interface]] (There, cf.
    =Camera Hardware Parameters= through
    =Camera Calibration Parameters=.)

  - GPS data and image information are fed into the database using
    option =--store-images-and-points= of the [[Command Line Interface]].

  - Presentation project users use the web interface to point in a map
    at a point of interest and are shown a couple of relevant images.
    In these images they point at features of interest the coordinates
    of which can be stored into the database.  (Storage not yet
    implemented; coordinates are just shown.)

* Command Line Interface

  The command line interface is used to

  - initialize a fresh PostgreSQL database
    (=./phoros --create-sys-tables ...=),

  - set up and manage acquisition projects
    (=./phoros --create-acquisition-project ...=),

  - store camera calibration parameters (=--store-camera-hardware=,
    =--store-device-stage-of-life=, =--store-camera-calibration= etc.),

  - store measurement data, i.e., images and GPS positions
    (=./phoros --store-images-and-points ...=),

  - manage presentation projects and presentation project users
    (=--create-presentation-project=, =--create-user= etc.),

  - start Phoros as a presentation server (a web server presenting
    measurement data to presentation project users) by
    =./phoros --server ...=.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ./phoros --help
  #+END_SRC
  emits a rather comprehensive [[file:phoros--help.org][help message]].

* Web Interface (with screenshots)

  Once images, calibration data and definitions of users and projects
  have been stored using the [[Command Line Interface]], Phoros can be
  started as a web server:
#+BEGIN_SRC: sh
$ ./phoros --server  --common-root=/some_path/where_i_put/my_raw_images/ \
>          --host=my_server --port=5432 --database=my_projects \
>          --user=database_admin --password=SeCrEt
#+END_SRC:
  A user can than point their browser at Phoros' URL.  Example:
  =http://localhost:8080/phoros/beautiful-cities= connects to
  presentation project =beautiful-cities= (and asks for username and
  password).

** Choose a point from the map
   In the map, points are shown where pictures have been taken.[fn:: Actually,
   the map should display where the "photographer" has looked rather
   than where he stood, but this is not yet implemented.]
   Pointing into an area of interest lets Phoros display a few[fn::
   The number of images can be specified during server
   start. Example:  @<code>phoros --server --images=N ... @</code>]
   relevant images.

   #+ATTR_HTML: style="border:2px solid darkgrey"
   [[file:map-click.png]]

** Point into first image
   After zooming into a first image and selecting a feature of
   interest, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipolar_line#Epipolar_line][epipolar lines]] appear in the other images which may be
   helpful in recognising the selected feature there.
   
   #+ATTR_HTML: style="border:2px solid darkgrey"
   [[file:image-click-1.png]]
   
** Point into second image
   Zooming in and selecting the same feature in another image
   triggers calculation of the estimated global position.  The
   estimated position is now shown in all images and in the map.
   Neither estimated position accuracy nor pointing precision are bounded by pixel
   size.
   
   #+ATTR_HTML: style="border:2px solid darkgrey"
   [[file:image-click-2.png]]
   
** Improve accuracy
   Zooming in and pointing at the feature in a third image improves
   accuracy.
   
   #+ATTR_HTML: style="border:2px solid darkgrey"
   [[file:image-click-3.png]]
   
   Although it doesn't seem necessary in this example, more images
   could be used to improve accuracy even further.
   
   #+ATTR_HTML: style="border:2px solid darkgrey"
   [[file:image-view-4.png]]

** Store point
   Finishing this point means storing it in a dedicated user point table.

* Download

  - Browse Phoros source code via gitweb at
    [[http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=phoros;a=summary][Berlios]]
    or at
    [[http://github.com/trebb/phoros][Github]].

  - Browse source code of [[mailto:Steffen.Scheller.home@gmail.com][Steffen Scheller]]'s [[http://github.com/trebb/phoml][PhoML]] library, which is needed by Phoros.

  - Get everything:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ git clone git://git.berlios.de/phoros
    $ cd phoros
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    #+END_SRC

    The build process isn't perfect yet.  You'll (probably) need an x86-64 Debian
    system with [[http://beta.quicklisp.org][Quicklisp]] installed on top of [[http://www.sbcl.org][SBCL]].

* Acknowledgements

  - Phoros is implemented using [[http://sbcl.org][Steel Bank Common Lisp]], a Common Lisp implementation.

  - Communication with [[http://postgresql.org][PostgreSQL]] is provided by [[http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/postmodern/][Postmodern]].

  - The presentation server is based on [[http://weitz.de/hunchentoot][Hunchentoot]].

  - Almost everything visible in the web browser looks as it does
    thanks to the [[http://openlayers.org][OpenLayers]] library, interfaced by [[http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/][Parenscript]] and
    [[http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-json/][CL-JSON]].

  - Without [[mailto:Steffen.Scheller.home@gmail.com][Steffen Scheller]]'s photogrammetric library [[http://github.com/trebb/phoml][PhoML]] Phoros'
    presentation server couldn't do much beyond displaying
    geolocated images. 

  - Once decoded, images are turned into something a web browser can
    handle by [[http://www.xach.com/lisp/zpng/][ZPNG]].

  - Leap second information is taken from the [[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc][Earth Orientation Center]].

  - [[http://www.openstreetmap.org][OpenStreetMap]] provides the map.  (Other map services can be used
    as well, though.)
