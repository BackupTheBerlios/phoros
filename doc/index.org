A Tool for Photogrammetric Road Survey

* Workflow

  - Images and GPS data are acquired using a measuring vehicle. ([[http://www.tu-dresden.de/vkiva/strasse/messfahrzeug.html][Here]]
    is a working example.)

    Sequences of a few hundred images together with their trigger times are stored
    Huffman-encoded in files called =*.pictures=.  GPS data is
    preprocessed into a table of ASCII text.  The format of both image
    and GPS files is not (yet) explained here.

  - Cameras and GPS system need to be calibrated, which is not
    explained here.

  - Calibration parameters are stored into the database using the
    [[Command Line Interface]] (There, cf.
    =Camera Hardware Parameters= through
    =Camera Calibration Parameters=.)

  - GPS data and image information are fed into the database using
    option =--store-images-and-points= of the [[Command Line Interface]].

  - Presentation project users use the web interface to point in a map
    at a point of interest and are shown a couple of relevant images.
    In these images they point at features of interest the coordinates
    of which can be stored into the database.  (Storage not yet
    implemented; coordinates are just shown.)

* Command Line Interface

  The command line interface is used to

  - set up and manage projects,

  - store camera calibration parameters,

  - store measurement data (i.e., images and GPS positions),

  - manage presentation project users,

  - start Phoros as a presentation server (a web server presenting
    measurement data to presentation project users).

  Below is the output of
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ./phoros --help
  #+END_SRC

#+INCLUDE "../phoros-help.txt" example

* Web Interface (with screenshots)

  - In the map, points are shown where pictures have been taken.[fn:: Actually,
    the map should display where the "photographer" has looked rather
    than where he stood, but this is not yet implemented.]
    Pointing into an area of interest lets Phoros display a few[fn::
    The number of images can be specified during server
    start. Example:  phoros --server --images=N ...]
    relevant images.

  - After zooming into a first image and selecting a feature of
    interest, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipolar_line#Epipolar_line][epipolar lines]] appear in the other images which may be
    helpful in recognising the selected feature there.

  - Zooming in and selecting the same feature in another image
    triggers calculation of the estimated global position.  The
    estimated position is now shown in all images and in the map
    (where the initially displayed sequence of points has been
    switched off to make this more obvious).  Neither estimated
    position accuracy nor pointing precision are bounded by pixel
    size.

  - Zooming in and pointing at the feature in a third image improves
    accuracy.

    #+ATTR_HTML: style="width:90%; border:2px solid darkgrey"
    [[file:image-click-3.png]]

  - Although it doesn't seem necessary in this example, more images
    could be used to improve accuracy even further.

* Download

  - Browse Phoros source code via [[http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=phoros;a=summary][gitweb]].  

  - Browse source code of [[mailto:Steffen.Scheller.home@gmail.com][Steffen Scheller]]'s [[http://github.com/trebb/phoml][PhoML]] library, which is needed by Phoros.

  - Get everything:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ git clone git://git.berlios.de/phoros
    $ cd phoros
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ wget http://openlayers.org/download/OpenLayers-2.10.tar.gz
    $ tar -xzf OpenLayers-2.10.tar.gz
    #+END_SRC

    The build process isn't perfect yet.  You'll (probably) need an x86-64 Debian
    system with [[http://beta.quicklisp.org][Quicklisp]] installed on top of [[http://www.sbcl.org][SBCL]].

* Acknowledgements

  - Phoros is implemented using [[http://sbcl.org][Steel Bank Common Lisp]], a Common Lisp implementation.

  - Communication with PostgrSQL is provided by [[http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/postmodern/][Postmodern]].

  - The presentation server is based on [[http://weitz.de/hunchentoot][Hunchentoot]].

  - Almost everything visible in the web browser looks as it does
    thanks to the [[http://openlayers.org][OpenLayers]] library, interfaced by [[http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/][Parenscript]] and
    [[http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-json/][CL-JSON]].

  - Without Steffen Scheller's photogrammetric library [[http://github.com/trebb/phoml][PhoML]] Phoros'
    presentation server couldn't do much beyond displaying
    geolocated images. 

  - Once decoded, images are turned into something a web browser can
    handle by [[http://www.xach.com/lisp/zpng/][ZPNG]].

  - Leap second information is taken from the [[http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc][Earth Orientation Center]].

  - [[http://www.openstreetmap.org][OpenStreetMap]] provides the map.  (Other map services can be used
    as well, though.)

  - It's a pleasure to have this project hosted at
